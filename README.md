# Nameless Universal Gamestore (N)

N is a gamestore that is fully compatible with all Linux devices, with the only requirement being the use of apt or pacman. Started on 02/01/2022, N currently has a small but growing support team.

## Why do scripts compile instead of downloading a precompiled package?

Because Im lazy? No (But I am, no doubt)

If you compile, your result is a BIT faster (More performance) than prebuilt ones, making the game go at ~1-10fps more. And if we want pi to run Doom 3 nicely, I will make it able to do it. :D

## TODO:

- More support
- GUI (Will be made in Node.js and Python, more info in Discord)

All scripts have been made by @isaacmv#0656 for [N](https://github.com/IsaacMvmv/N), meaning that if you find another store with the same scripts, you know who was first. If you want to include N in your repo, store, gamestore, or any other project, feel free to contact us on our Discord server.
