# N

Nameless pi gaming appstore

The project started on  02/01/2022, It has tiny support right now (Some persons, but its going well by now)


# Why do scripts compile instead of downloading a precompiled package:

  Because Im lazy? No (But I am, no doubt)

  If you compile, your resoult is a BIT faster (More performance) than prebuilt ones, making the game go at ~1-10fps more. And if we want pi to run doom3 nice, I will make it able to to it. :D
